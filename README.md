# Godot Start

A Windows Godot Manager

### Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a reliable and easy way to download Godot versions and use them for editing my projects.

Before I worked on this project, I tried out Godot Version Manager and Hourglass. I found both of these applications to be insufficient for my needs. Hourglass needs to be manually updated for each Godot Version and it has not been updated since 4.1.1-stable (roughtly a year ago). So if you want to install a new version of Godot via Hourglass, you are SOL. On the other hand, I found Godot Version Manager to be a mess and I didn't enjoy using it. It is a decent piece of software, but the developers took the UI/UX in a different direction than I enjoy.

This program aims to be a no-frills Godot version/project manager. I decided (starting off) this application would be Windows-only using WinUI3 as the framework. Why WinUI3? Because I wanted to learn it. In hind-sight I am far less impressed with the framework and there is a chance I will port this over to another framework.

This is how it currently looks:

### Installation

### Features

### FAQ

1. Do you have a roadmap?

- All milestones will be tracked via issues. Feel free to look there for any information.

2. Why are you auto-generating your view models in a separate project?

- I saw someone recommend it online, so I decided to try it out. Normally I refrain from auto-generation, but we will see if I stick with this package. It forces the observable properties to be very simplistic, which has turned a few simply problems into more difficult challenges.

3. Linux? Mac?

- Possibly, but not yet explicitly on the plan.
